## Business Problem

Air pollution has been an increasingly prevelant problem all over the world, but particularly China. Energy related emmision increased over 80% in the past 10 years leading to the accleration of global warming as well as increased number of deaths. In 2015 it was estimated that nearly 1.6 million deaths in China were attributed to the high pollution levels in the country. To mitigate such harm, it is important to understand our relationship with the climate through historical data. To truly put our best foot forward, would be to use data insights into predicting future air pollution and how we can better understand from historical data the right and wrong paths taken. 

## The Data
The dataset used is the [Beijing Air Pollution](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+Multi-Site+Air-Quality+Data). The dataset contains just over 1200 rows and 9 columns that we manipulated when we were importing the data. Please see the Getting the Data notebook to get the full picture. I also decided to resampe the datset with daily frequency for both easier handling and proximity to real use case scenarios.
